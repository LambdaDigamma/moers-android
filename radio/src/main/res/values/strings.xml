    <string name="community_radio_description">Every day between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Radio K.W. (Sundays and holidays from 7:04 p.m.), there is a slightly different kind of radio - community radio. People from the county of Wesel spend many hours of their free time in production studios to send an hour of radio programming over the airwaves every day.</string>
